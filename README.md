### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tiina, a IT consultant based in Helsinki, Finland. I'm passionate about cloud development and cyber security and always looking for new ways to challenge myself and grow professionally.

Iâ€™m a career changer and I participated in Academic Work Academy training camp in summer of 2022 (3 months). During the summer, we learned the essentials of AWS cloud and during fall 2022, I became a certified AWS Developer Associate ðŸ”¥

Since then, Iâ€™ve continued upgrading my skills with a lot of different things, for example some fullstack development, Terraform and some hacking with hackthebox.com. 



## ðŸ’¼ Experience

Accenture Nordics - Software Engineer  (9/2022 - 4/2023)
- Planning and executing a internal project
